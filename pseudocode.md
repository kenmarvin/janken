// Make a function that returns a random value of either scissors, paper, or rock.
// Make a function that returns and evaluates the choices of the player, for example if the player chooses rock then it would be able to value it as a rock and evaluate it case-insensitively.
// Make a chain of if conditionals that will create an algorithm to compare and evaluate the result of the match.
